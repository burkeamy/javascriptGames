#JavaScript Games

I used the "I'm a JavaScript Games maker" books to create these games. I wanted to dive a little deeper in to making games using JavaScript, and these books were great. 

All files use JavaScript and HTML. The home page adds CSS and some flexbox.

The UFO game is not working yet. It will put you in a loop, so I advise you don't open it.
